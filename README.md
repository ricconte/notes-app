# Notes app

Here's how this app works:

- The app has a textarea and a button for adding new notes.
- When the user clicks the "Add Note" button, the app adds the note to an array of notes.
- The app then clears the input field and re-renders the notes list.
- The notes list is simply an unordered list (`<ul>`) with a list item (`<li>`) for each note in the array.

You can customize this code to add more features, such as the ability to edit or delete notes, or to save the notes to localStorage so they persist across page reloads. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
